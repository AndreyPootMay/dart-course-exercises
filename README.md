## Dart Course Notes and Practices

This excercises belongs to the [Fernando Herrera's Dart Language Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-de-cero-hasta-los-detalles/).

The lessons inside this course are:

01. Basics (Data-types, asign values and consts).
02. Control operators and structures (Input, if, else, for, for-in, while, do-while, break-continue, label-for and switch-case).
03. Functions (Basics, Arguments, Functions per value and reference, lambda functions and callbacks).
04. Uncommon Data-types inside Dart (Queues, Enum, Futures, Async-Await, catch-error and streams).
05. Classes (Classes, Final props, factory constructor and singleton).
06. Classes Advanced (Extends, Abstracts, Super-Constructor, Override and Mixins).
07. Docs (Learning how to read and search inside the dart documentation).

## Important

I was doing the course using the version 2.8.4 (stable) of the Dart SDK, if some of the language or the functions would change, I correct it.
